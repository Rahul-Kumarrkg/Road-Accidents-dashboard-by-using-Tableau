Accident analysis is a process carried out in order to determine the cause or causes of an accident (that can result in single or multiple outcomes).
A road accident dataset dashboard is a visual tool that summarizes and analyzes road accident data to provide insights into safety trends and patterns. It typically uses charts, graphs, and tables to display key information such as the number of accidents, casualties (fatalities and injuries), vehicle types involved, and other factors like road conditions and time of day. This allows users to quickly grasp the extent and nature of road accidents in a specific region or time period, helping identify areas for improvement and informing strategies to enhance road safety.
